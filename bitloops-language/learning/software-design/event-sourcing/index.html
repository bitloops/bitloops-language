Pattern</h1><p>Event sourcing is a design pattern that has been gaining popularity in recent years as a powerful tool for building robust and scalable software systems. At its core, event sourcing involves capturing all changes made to an application&#x27;s data as a sequence of events, rather than simply storing the current state of the data. This approach allows developers to rebuild the state of the application at any point in time, by replaying the sequence of events that led up to that point.</p><p>The concept of event sourcing was first introduced in the early 2000s, and has since been refined and popularized by thought leaders in the software development community. Event sourcing is often used in conjunction with other patterns and techniques, such as CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and domain-driven design, to build complex, event-driven systems that can scale to meet the demands of modern applications. In the following sections, we will explore the benefits and challenges of event sourcing, as well as some practical tips for implementing this pattern in your own software systems.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="event-sourcing-core-principles">Event Sourcing Core Principles<a href="#event-sourcing-core-principles" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Event Sourcing Core Principles" title="Direct link to Event Sourcing Core Principles">​</a></h2><p>The first core principle of event sourcing is the use of an append-only event store. This store captures all changes made to the application&#x27;s data as a series of immutable events. Unlike traditional CRUD-based architectures where data is overwritten each time it is updated, event sourcing preserves every state change, allowing for a complete audit trail of the application&#x27;s history. This also enables developers to rebuild the state of the application at any point in time by replaying the events in sequence.</p><p>The second core principle is the ability to rebuild the application&#x27;s state at any point in time using the events stored in the event store. This is possible because each event represents a discrete, self-contained unit of information that captures everything that happened within the system at a specific point in time. By replaying the events in the correct order, developers can reconstruct the entire state of the application at any point in time, allowing for accurate historical analysis and precise diagnosis of bugs and issues.</p><p>Finally, event sourcing involves the separation of write and read models. The write model is responsible for updating the event store with new events, while the read model is responsible for projecting the events into a format that is optimized for querying and reporting. This separation allows for greater flexibility and scalability in the design of the system. The read model can be tailored to meet specific query and reporting requirements, while the write model can be optimized for data consistency and durability. This also allows for the use of different data storage technologies for the write and read models, depending on their specific needs.</p><p>Overall, the core principles of event sourcing provide a powerful and flexible way to build complex software systems that can be easily audited and debugged, and that can support a wide range of queries and reporting requirements.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="differences-from-traditional-architecture">Differences from Traditional Architecture<a href="#differences-from-traditional-architecture" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Differences from Traditional Architecture" title="Direct link to Differences from Traditional Architecture">​</a></h2><p>Event sourcing differs from traditional CRUD-based architectures in several ways. First and foremost, event sourcing is based on capturing all changes made to an application&#x27;s data as a sequence of events, rather than just the current state of the data. This means that event sourcing systems can more easily manage complex data requirements, as they can track changes to data over time and use that data to build up a more complete picture of the system&#x27;s state.</p><p>Another key difference between event sourcing and traditional architectures is that event sourcing supports event-driven architectures. In an event-driven architecture, events are used to trigger actions or updates across different components of the system. Because event sourcing systems capture all changes as events, they can easily integrate with event-driven architectures and enable developers to build more flexible, resilient, and scalable systems.</p><p>Finally, event sourcing emphasizes the separation of write and read models. Write models are responsible for capturing and storing events, while read models are used to query and report on the data stored in the event store. By separating these two models, event sourcing systems can better support complex queries and reporting needs, without impacting the write model&#x27;s performance or availability.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-does-event-sourcing-work">How does Event Sourcing work<a href="#how-does-event-sourcing-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How does Event Sourcing work" title="Direct link to How does Event Sourcing work">​</a></h2><p>In event sourcing, data is not updated directly, but rather by creating a new event that represents the change. These events are then stored in the event store, which acts as the source of truth for the application&#x27;s data. Each event contains information about what changed, when it changed, and any relevant metadata.</p><p>To reconstruct the current state of the application, all the events in the event store are replayed in order, with each event applied to the application&#x27;s state. This allows the application to be rebuilt to any point in time by replaying only the relevant events.</p><p>Separating the write and read models allows for more efficient querying and reporting. The write model is responsible for handling user input and creating events that represent changes to the application&#x27;s state. The read model is then responsible for subscribing to these events and updating itself to reflect the current state of the application. By separating these concerns, the read model can be optimized for specific queries and reporting needs, without affecting the performance of the write model.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="advantages-of-event-sourcing">Advantages of Event Sourcing<a href="#advantages-of-event-sourcing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Advantages of Event Sourcing" title="Direct link to Advantages of Event Sourcing">​</a></h2><p>One of the main advantages of event sourcing is its ability to support complex data requirements. By capturing all changes made to an application&#x27;s data as a sequence of events, event sourcing enables developers to easily manage complex data structures and relationships that would be difficult to handle using traditional CRUD-based architectures. This is particularly useful in domains where the data model is subject to frequent change or needs to support a wide range of queries and reporting.</p><p>Another key advantage of event sourcing is improved scalability and performance. By storing data as a sequence of events in an append-only event store, event sourcing allows for efficient and high-performance data storage and retrieval. Additionally, because events are immutable, event sourcing can be used to support distributed architectures and multi-node systems, making it a great choice for building highly scalable and performant applications.</p><p>Event sourcing also offers increased reliability and fault tolerance. Because events are immutable and stored in an append-only event store, they can never be lost or corrupted, and can always be used to rebuild the state of the application in case of failure or downtime. This makes event sourcing a great choice for building mission-critical systems that require high levels of reliability and uptime.</p><p>Finally, event sourcing enables developers to easily support event-driven architectures. By capturing all changes made to an application&#x27;s data as a sequence of events, event sourcing allows for easy integration with other systems and applications that rely on event-driven messaging or streaming data. This makes it a great choice for building microservices-based architectures or other distributed systems that need to communicate with other services or systems in real-time.</p><p>Overall, event sourcing offers a range of advantages that make it a compelling choice for building complex software systems that require high levels of scalability, performance, reliability, and flexibility.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="challenges-in-implementing-event-sourcing">Challenges in implementing Event Sourcing<a href="#challenges-in-implementing-event-sourcing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Challenges in implementing Event Sourcing" title="Direct link to Challenges in implementing Event Sourcing">​</a></h2><p>Implementing event sourcing can present several challenges that developers should be aware of. One of the primary challenges is the need to carefully design the event schema. Since all changes to the system&#x27;s data are captured as a sequence of events, it&#x27;s critical to carefully consider the structure and content of those events to ensure they provide enough information to enable the application to be rebuilt at any point in time. This requires careful thought and planning to ensure that the event schema can accommodate future changes and scale with the system&#x27;s needs.</p><p>Another challenge of event sourcing is the management of the event store&#x27;s growth over time. Since events are never deleted, the event store can grow quite large, which can impact performance and scalability. This requires careful consideration of storage requirements and the use of appropriate tools and technologies to manage and optimize the event store.</p><p>Concurrency and data consistency are also significant challenges when implementing event sourcing. Since multiple events can be written concurrently, it&#x27;s critical to ensure that data consistency is maintained throughout the system. This requires the use of appropriate concurrency controls, such as optimistic or pessimistic locking, and careful management of transactions to ensure that data is consistent and accurate at all times.</p><p>Overall, while event sourcing offers many benefits, it also presents several challenges that must be carefully considered and managed to ensure the system&#x27;s success.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="best-use-cases-for-event-sourcing">Best use cases for Event Sourcing<a href="#best-use-cases-for-event-sourcing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Best use cases for Event Sourcing" title="Direct link to Best use cases for Event Sourcing">​</a></h2><p>Event sourcing is a powerful pattern that can be applied to a wide range of systems. Some of the best use cases for implementing event sourcing include systems with complex data requirements that require the ability to support event-driven architectures and real-time data processing. In addition, systems that require high reliability, fault tolerance or high availability benefit greatly from event sourcing.</p><p>Another broad value proposition is the ability to track and audit changes over time, such as regulatory compliance systems or healthcare systems. By capturing all changes to the application&#x27;s data in a sequence of events, event sourcing provides a comprehensive audit trail that can be used to support compliance requirements and provide greater transparency and accountability.</p><p>More specifically, event sourcing can be particularly effective in the following use cases:</p><p>A) Financial applications – Event sourcing can help maintain an accurate audit trail of all financial transactions.</p><p>B) E-commerce platforms – Event sourcing can help track all order processing events, including order creation, modification, and payment processing.</p><p>C) Healthcare systems – Event sourcing can help track all patient data changes, including diagnoses, treatments, and medication changes.</p><p>D) Logistics and supply chain management – Event sourcing can help track all changes to inventory levels, shipping and receiving events, and supply chain disruptions.</p><p>E) Social media platforms – Event sourcing can help track all user interactions, including posts, comments, likes, and shares.</p><p>F) Gaming platforms – Event sourcing can help track all game events, including player movements, game state changes, and user interactions.</p><p>G) IoT and sensor data – Event sourcing can help capture and analyze sensor data over time, enabling predictive maintenance and anomaly detection.</p><p>H) Trading and financial markets – Event sourcing can help track all trading events, including order submissions, executions, and cancellations.</p><p>I) Real-time monitoring and alerting – Event sourcing can help monitor and alert on real-time events, such as system failures or anomalies in data streams.</p><p>J) Data analytics and machine learning – Event sourcing can help capture and store event data for analysis and model training purposes.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-implement-event-sourcing">How to implement Event Sourcing<a href="#how-to-implement-event-sourcing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to implement Event Sourcing" title="Direct link to How to implement Event Sourcing">​</a></h2><p>Implementing event sourcing requires a very good understanding of your domain or problem, and the combination of event sourcing with DDD can be very powerful. Below is a list of steps to follow when considering implementing event sourcing:</p><ol><li><p>Identify the key entities in your system that will generate events, such as users, products, or orders.</p></li><li><p>Define the types of events that will be generated by these entities. Each event should capture the state changes that occur for that entity, and should include a timestamp and a unique identifier.</p></li><li><p>Set up an append-only event store to capture these events. This can be done using a variety of technologies, such as a relational database with versioning, a NoSQL database, or a dedicated event store solution.</p></li><li><p>Define the read models that will be used to support complex queries and reporting. These read models can be derived from the event stream using tools like event processors or projections.</p></li><li><p>Implement the write-side of the event sourcing system by writing code to handle the generation of events and the updating of the event store.</p></li><li><p>Implement the read-side of the system by writing code to generate the read models based on the event stream.</p></li><li><p>Implement any necessary data migration processes to transition from a traditional CRUD-based architecture to an event sourcing architecture.</p></li><li><p>Test the system thoroughly to ensure that events are being captured correctly, the event store is functioning properly, and the read models are providing the expected results.</p></li><li><p>Monitor the system in production to ensure that events are being captured correctly and that the event store is functioning properly.</p></li><li><p>Continuously evaluate and refine the system as needed to ensure that it is meeting the business requirements and delivering value to the end-users.</p></li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="recap---why-you-should-consider-event-sourcing">Recap - why you should consider event sourcing<a href="#recap---why-you-should-consider-event-sourcing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Recap - why you should consider event sourcing" title="Direct link to Recap - why you should consider event sourcing">​</a></h2><p>In summary, event sourcing provides a valuable approach to data management in software systems by creating an immutable record of changes made to the data. This approach supports complex data requirements and event-driven architectures, while also enabling separation of read and write models for more efficient querying and reporting. </p><p>To complement this, <a href="https://bitloops.com/docs/bitloops-language/learning/software-design/domain-driven-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Domain-Driven Design (DDD)</a>, <a href="https://bitloops.com/docs/bitloops-language/learning/software-architecture/hexagonal-architecture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hexagonal Architecture</a>, and <a href="https://bitloops.com/docs/bitloops-language/learning/software-design/cqrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)</a> can be excellent tools to ensure a clear separation of concerns and a scalable architecture. Though implementing event sourcing can present some challenges, careful planning, design, and management can overcome them. By leveraging the benefits of event sourcing and its complementary tools, developers can build more reliable and performant applications with the potential to transform the way data is managed in software systems.</p><p>Overall, it is recommended that developers consider the use of event sourcing in their software systems. By exploring the various tools and frameworks available for implementing event sourcing, developers can leverage its many benefits and build more scalable, reliable, and performant applications. Event sourcing is a powerful tool for modern software development, and it has the potential to transform the way we build and manage data in our systems.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/bitloops/bitloops-language/edit/main/documentation/docs/learning/software-design/event-sourcing.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/docs/bitloops-language/learning/software-design/cqrs"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">CQRS</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/docs/bitloops-language/learning/software-design-books"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Other learning resources</div></a></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#event-sourcing-core-principles" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Event Sourcing Core Principles</a></li><li><a href="#differences-from-traditional-architecture" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Differences from Traditional Architecture</a></li><li><a href="#how-does-event-sourcing-work" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">How does Event Sourcing work</a></li><li><a href="#advantages-of-event-sourcing" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Advantages of Event Sourcing</a></li><li><a href="#challenges-in-implementing-event-sourcing" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Challenges in implementing Event Sourcing</a></li><li><a href="#best-use-cases-for-event-sourcing" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Best use cases for Event Sourcing</a></li><li><a href="#how-to-implement-event-sourcing" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">How to implement Event Sourcing</a></li><li><a href="#recap---why-you-should-consider-event-sourcing" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Recap - why you should consider event sourcing</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/bitloops-language/category/introduction">Bitloops Language</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bitloops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Linkedin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/bitloops" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2022 - 2023 Bitloops S.A.</div></div></div></footer></div>
