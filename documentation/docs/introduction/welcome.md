# üëã Welcome!

You‚Äôve probably found Bitloops Language because you are keen on becoming a great software engineer. You want and efficient and effective way learn and implement software engineering design patterns and principles, that doesn't require years of experience, good mentors and lots of reading. 

Well, you‚Äôre definitely at the right place! Bitloops‚Äô goal is precisely to ensure that software development teams build great quality software that allows them to maintain high levels of productivity throughout the entire lifecycle of their project by ensuring code is readable, maintainable and flexible. 

Our documentation is still a work in progress, but there are many valuable insights and loads of information regarding how Bitloops works and why it will help you build better software.

&nbsp; 

## üîë Why you should use Bitloops

Software development is a craft that requires combining knowledge, expertise and creativity in building digital solutions to a particular problem. 

However, as with most crafts you need time to build up that experience, be exposed to many different situations and continuously learn about software design and development principles that improve system quality, maintainability and flexibility. 

Nothing can substitute experience, however, it's the quality of the experience (practice) that ultimately determines the success. They say practice makes perfect, but that‚Äôs only if you practise correctly! 

Bitloops Language has incorporated industry best practices for software design and development into the coding process. This includes concepts such as [domain-driven design](https://bitloops.com/docs/bitloops-language/learning/domain-driven-design), [behaviour-driven development](https://bitloops.com/docs/bitloops-language/learning/behavior-driven-development), [test-driven development](https://bitloops.com/docs/bitloops-language/learning/test-driven-development), [hexagonal architecture](https://bitloops.com/docs/bitloops-language/learning/Software%20Architecture/hexagonal-architecture) and many well-known methodologies such as event-storming, Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), separation of concerns and event sourcing.

We have built Bitloops to empower developers to build high-quality and well designed software, in a faster and easier way. With Bitloops, developers not only build great applications, but they improve their knowledge and understanding of these best practices and methodologies whilst implementing them, becoming better software engineers in the process.

## üéÅ What's in the current release?
The current release is mostly focused on the Bitloops Language, its syntax and ease of use. 

With this release, developers will be able to understand how the Bitloops language structures code and encourage developers to think about their domain problem in such a way that allows them to code it with Bitloops in a more readable and flexible way. 

The Bitloops Language is open-source, so if you do encounter any issue or limitation, feel free to add feedback on our GitHub page, or contribute to any outstanding issues.

## What's next?
We are currently working on an Alpha release of the Bitloops Language, as well as a comprehensive tutorial where we explain how you can build a ride-hailing platform using Bitloops, explaining how the important software design and architecture principles are applied. 

As an immediate next step, we recommend (and would greatly appreciate) [staring our Repo](https://github.com/bitloops/bitloops-language) and then selecting one of the following options:
