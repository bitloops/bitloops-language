- High-productivity, [fourth generation (4GL)](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24308/fourth-generation-programming-language-4gl) transpiled programming language
- Easy to learn and get started with
- Focused on [Domain-Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) and [Behavior-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) ([DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)/[BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development)) with testing as a 1st class citizen
- Add different API controllers (REST, GraphQL, gRPC) with just a few lines of code
- Modular Monolith or Microservices architecture? Both! Switch back and forth within minutes as all messages are moved through either in-memory or distributed message buses depending on your deployment choice
- Significantly reduce the amount of boilerplate code you need to write and maintain
- Ensure alignment between business and engineering with a natural ubiquitous language
- Transpiles to widely used programming languages for maximum compatibility with existing code (currently only [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) support, Java, C#, C++ or [Carbon](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang) to follow in the future)
