# Test Driven Development

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process, similar to BDD that encourages developers to build test cases that represent the expected outcomes before the development of the actual code.

## What is TDD exactly?

The basic concept of TDD is that all code is written in order to solve a test case. More specifically:

- You cannot write any code unless there is a failing test you want to pass
- You cannot write any more of a unit test than is sufficient for it to fail
- You cannot write any more production code than is sufficient to pass a failing test

## Why use TDD?

TDD has several benefits:

- Robust code enables faster innovation and continuous delivery
- Low risk of braking code as the code is flexible and extensible so can be refactored or moved with minimal risk
- TDD code is easy to test (that's one of the principles), meaning it's easy to understand
- Productivity: The requirements are implemented as efficiently as possible because only the function that is needed is written


# Red, Green, Refactor

Another interesting concept in TDD is the Red, Green, Refactor idea or process. 

Essentially, it states the following:
1. Write a test that fails: Red
2. Write code that passes test: Green
3. Refactor code so its "cleaner" (but test still passes): Refactor
