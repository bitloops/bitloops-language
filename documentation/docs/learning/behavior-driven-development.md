# Behavior Driven Development

Software is basically trying to emulate a particular behavior. Therefore, there is an agile software development process that encourages developers to think specifically about behavior. This process is called Behavior Driven Development. 

This process brings together many specialists, and encourages deep conversation to define concrete examples of the behaviors expected by the users and the software. This creates a shared understanding of the domain as we as how the applicaiton should behave in the various scenarios. 

## What is BDD exactly?

BDD actually emerged from TDD which is very similar conceptually, but is more specific to the actual coding process where test are created before the actual code is written. Therefore, developers write which tests need to "pass" to represent that particular feature or behavior, and then write the code to make that test pass. 

Behavior Driven Development is very much a combination of DDD, TDD and object oriented analysis and design that empowers teams to build better software. In fact, BDD is a great way for non-technical team members to better contribute to product and technology in their companies. The use of simple domain-specific language to experess the behaviors and expected outcomes can be done by any business user, and then the developers can better (faster and cheaper) convert that into code.
