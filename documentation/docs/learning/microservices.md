# Microservices

Microservices is a software architecture that structures applications or software systems into a collection or group of smaller services that work together. This allows specialization of certain tasks.

## What is a microservice?

A microservice is a specific service, sometimes smaller but many times quite large actually, that supports a specific business goal or task. It normally uses a well defined interface or API to communicate with other services and can be used by multiple applications if designed correctly. 


## Is an API a microservice?

No. A microservice is a single service and microservices are many services working together to form a complete architecture with multiple services that create an application. An API is a component of a microservice and is used to ensure the communication with other microservices is effective. There are several components of a microservice that are required to make a system work such as business logic, APIs, a data access layer, and a database.
