# Setup

## GraphQL

You've defined your GraphQL Controllers, operation types, their input and output DTOs. Now you just need to provide this information to the GraphQL Server when you initialize it.

The GraphQL server constructor requires to provide a port and your set of graphQL controllers.
Your schema will be generated by the associated controllers.

#### **`setup.bl`**

```ts
GraphQLServer({
    port: env.APOLLO_SERVER || 5002,
  }) {
    [Demo][Hello World]HelloWorldGQLController();
}
```

You are familiar with the **`[Demo][Hello World]`** syntax by now which indicates the bounded context and module where your controller resides.

## Package

You've defined your [PackagePort](https://bitloops.com/docs/bitloops-language/components/package-port) and your concrete [PackageAdapter](https://bitloops.com/docs/bitloops-language/components/package-adapter) and now you want to instantiate it in the setup. So, when you use the package in your application it will use the adapter that you have specified in the setup.

### Example

#### **`setup.bl`**

```ts
[Demo][Hello World]BitloopsGherkinPackageAdapter concretes GherkinPackagePort;
```

You can use the above package in your application like this:

```ts
const bytes = GherkinPackage.encode(value);
```

## UseCase

You've defined your [UseCase](https://bitloops.com/docs/bitloops-language/components/usecase) and now you want to instantiate it in the setup. Bounded Context and Module must be placed in front `[Todo][Todo]` and the dependencies passed as arguments `todoWriteRepo`, as it seems below:

_For multiple dependencies separate them by comma_

### Example

#### **`setup.bl`**

```ts
const updateTodoUseCase = [Todo][Todo]UpdateTodoUseCase(todoWriteRepo);
```
