# Code Snippet Examples

The idea here is to provide code snippets that we potentially use in the Elements folder, but it's gathered together to make it easy to understand 


For example, we may have code snippets for:
1. Hello Bitloopers 
2. Basic functions
3. Transformation of arrays or lists
4. If/else patterns
5. Type declarations
6. Exception handling
7. Basic file operations
