# What is Bitloops?

Bitloops is a frontend copilot that converts Figma designs into clean, reusable, production-ready code. It helps you automate repetitive tasks like component creation, layout scaffolding, asset extraction, and styling — while keeping you fully in control of the output.

Bitloops is built for professional developers who want to move faster without compromising quality. The goal isn't to replace developers, but to support them by offloading time-consuming UI work that follows patterns and best practices.

## What Bitloops does

- **Imports Figma designs** - entire pages or selected frames
- **Identifies layout structure**, reusable components, and variants
- **Generates React + Tailwind CSS code**, optimized for readability and reuse
- **Organizes code** with prop-driven components and flexible folder structure
- **Automatically generates Storybook stubs** for isolated component rendering
- **Generates responsive layouts** not just static desktop scaffolding
- **Extracts UI copy into mock JSON** for text elements and supports i18n workflows
- **Classifies images as static vs dynamic** generating correct imports and prop-driven APIs

## How Bitloops is different

Unlike tools that do direct element-to-code mapping, Bitloops interprets designs the way a senior engineer would. It looks for patterns, context, and hierarchy — then builds scalable UI code from that model. If a button appears in four places, Bitloops suggests a single component. If a layout uses repeating patterns, it structures them accordingly.

Bitloops doesn't require your design file to follow rigid conventions. It works with real-world, messy designs and still aims to generate high-quality code. And Bitloops doesn’t just generate code — it generates checks (tests and comparisons) to validate that the output matches the design intent.

## Transparent, not magic

There are many ways to build a UI — and Bitloops won't get it right every time. That's expected. The key is that the code it gives you is easy to understand and modify. You can rename props, restructure layout, or delete parts entirely and continue working.

Bitloops is built on the idea that AI should handle what's slow or tedious — and get out of your way when human judgment is faster or easier. For example, changing a couple of Tailwind classes is quick. But extracting a design pattern into a component API—props, states, and variants that scale across screens—takes real effort. Bitloops focuses on the latter.

## What it's not

- **Not a low-code builder** — you work with real code
- **Not a black box** — you can review, edit, and fully own your code
- **Not a generic design-to-code tool that “takes a best guess”** - get engineer-grade components you can trust and iterate
