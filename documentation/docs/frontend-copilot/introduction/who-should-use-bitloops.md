# Who should use Bitloops?

Bitloops is built for **developers** doing **frontend work** and teams who want to **ship professional-grade UI** faster—without giving up control of their code. It’s not a no-code website builder, and it’s not a “magic button.” It’s a copilot for engineers who can review output, make implementation decisions, and iterate.

## Ideal users

### Frontend / Fullstack Developers

- Building UIs in **React** (Bitloops currently outputs React + Tailwind CSS)
- Want to reduce boilerplate: layout scaffolding, component setup, variants, and repetitive UI structure
- Prefer clean, editable code over black-box output

### Tech Startups (3–10 devs)

- Shipping fast with evolving designs and frequent UI changes
- Need maintainable components early to avoid “rewrite it later”
- Want to compress the design-to-implementation cycle without sacrificing ownership

### Freelancers & Agencies

- Delivering multiple projects under tight timelines
- Need consistent, maintainable component structure across screens and clients
- Want a fast first pass that still feels like real engineering output

### Design System Builders

- Translating Figma patterns into reusable component libraries
- Need repeatable component boundaries, variants, and prop-driven APIs
- Want a tighter pipeline between design intent and implementation

## Works best when

Bitloops shines when the bottleneck is **UI structure and repetition**, not “inventing” product logic.

Use Bitloops when:

- Your designs include repeated patterns across screens (cards, headers, lists, forms, tables)
- You want to extract reusable components and build upward into larger sections and pages
- You care about maintainability: clear component boundaries, props, and variants
- Your team wants a fast baseline and an iteration loop (generate → compare → refine)
- Your Figma files are real-world and imperfect, and you want a tool that can still help—especially when you can steer it

## Common use cases

- Kickstarting a new project or feature from fresh designs
- Translating multi-screen designs into a reusable component library
- Rebuilding UI after design updates by extracting and extending components
- Refactoring messy UI into cleaner structure through better boundaries and reuse
- Working in a typical Git-based workflow (VS Code + PR review), where generated code is reviewed and refined like any other change

## When Bitloops isn't the right fit

Bitloops is **not** for:

- **Non-developers** who don’t want to work with code
- Projects that **do not start from (figma) design inputs** (e.g. UI built entirely ad-hoc or directly in code without a design reference)
- **Backend-focused developers** trying to “generate a website” without frontend implementation knowledge
- Teams seeking a **drag-and-drop page builder** rather than a code-first workflow
- Projects that aren’t a match for the current output stack (react/next.js + tailwind)

:::note
**Current output:** React with Tailwind CSS (Next.js–ready).
Support for additional frameworks and languages is planned, but today Bitloops is focused on teams shipping React component code.

## Designed for frontend ownership

Bitloops won’t get everything perfect on the first pass—no tool can. What matters is that the code is **yours**: readable, editable, and designed to be iterated on by a frontend engineer.

Whether you’re solo or on a growing team, Bitloops helps you scale UI delivery while keeping quality and maintainability high.
