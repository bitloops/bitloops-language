# Importing Designs

This guide shows you how to import a Figma design into your Bitloops **account library** and then add specific frames to your **current project**. We assume you’re already signed in and inside a project.

Bitloops won’t auto-generate components on import—you decide which frames to work on and when to start componentizing.

## When to use this

- You’re starting a new project and want to bring designs into Bitloops
- You’ve received new screens and want to add more frames to an existing project
- You want the full set of frames available so reuse, snapshots, and the design system are inferred more accurately

## Before you start

- You’re signed in to Bitloops
- You have a project open (folder opened + project created)
- You have access to the Figma file/page you’re importing

## How it works

Bitloops separates **importing** from **adding frames to a project**:

- Importing a Figma URL adds frames to **My Design Files** (account-level library)
- You then select which frames to **Add to Project**
- Only frames added to your project show up in Design View for component creation

## Steps

### 1) Open “My Design Files”

In the Bitloops sidebar, go to the Designs area and click the **+** button to open **My Design Files**.

✅ **Checkpoint:** You can see your design library (previously imported designs, if any).

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot: “+ button / My Design Files panel” -->

### 2) Import a Figma page URL

Inside **My Design Files**, click **Import**, then paste your **Figma page URL**.

Bitloops will import **all frames contained in that page** and add them to your account library.

✅ **Checkpoint:** The imported design file appears in **My Design Files**, and its frames are visible.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot: “Paste URL → Import → frames grid” -->

### 3) Add frames to your project

Select the frames you want to work with, then click **Add to Project**.

✅ **Checkpoint:** The selected frames are now available in your project’s **Design View**.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot: “Select frame(s) → Add to Project → success state” -->

### 4) Open Design View

Click **Take me to Design View** (or open Design View from the sidebar), then select one of the frames you added.

✅ **Checkpoint:** You can see the frame on the canvas and its element tree.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot: “Design View with imported frame visible” -->

## Notes

- Imported designs do **not** auto-sync with Figma (yet). If the design changes, import a second version or start a new project and re-run the flow.
- You can import once into your library and reuse the same design frames across multiple projects.
