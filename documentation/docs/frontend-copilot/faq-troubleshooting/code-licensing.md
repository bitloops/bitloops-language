# Code Licensing & Ownership

One of the most important questions when using any code generation tool is: **"Who owns the code?"**

With Bitloops, the answer is simple: **You do.**

## Full Ownership

All code generated by Bitloops is **100% yours**. You have complete ownership and can:

- Use it in personal projects
- Use it in commercial projects
- Modify it however you want
- Redistribute it as part of your applications
- Keep it private or make it open source

## No Lock-In

Bitloops generates **standard React + Tailwind CSS code**. There are:

- No proprietary dependencies
- No required runtime libraries
- No mandatory Bitloops imports
- No license restrictions on usage

The code works independently of Bitloops once generated. You can stop using Bitloops at any time and continue working with your generated code.

## What This Means for You

### For Individual Developers
- Use generated code in freelance projects
- Build your portfolio with Bitloops-generated components
- Learn from the code patterns and best practices

### For Teams & Companies
- Use in production applications
- Include in proprietary software
- No attribution required
- No royalty payments

### For Open Source Projects
- Generated code can be included in open source projects
- Compatible with any open source license
- No special considerations needed

## Your Designs

Similarly, Bitloops **never claims ownership** of your designs:

- Your Figma files remain yours
- Imported designs are only read, never modified
- We don't store or redistribute your designs
- You can delete imported designs at any time
