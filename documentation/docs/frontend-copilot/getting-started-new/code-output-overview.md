# Code Output Overview

This page explains the philosophy behind how code is generated by Bitloops, the structure and conventions used, and your options for customization.

## Code Generation Philosophy

Bitloops generates code with a few guiding principles:

1. **Readability first** — The code should be easy to understand for any React developer
2. **Editability** — You should be able to modify any part without breaking the whole system
3. **Production-ready** — The output follows industry best practices and is ready for deployment
4. **No lock-in** — The generated code is standard React + Tailwind; you own it completely

## Output Structure

When you create components in Bitloops, they are generated directly into your project folder with a clean, organized structure:

```
/components
  /Button
    index.tsx        # Main component file
    styles.ts        # Extracted styles (if applicable)
    test.spec.ts     # Test file with data-id selectors
  /Card
    index.tsx
    props.ts         # Props type definitions
    Snapshot.json    # Snapshot metadata
  /ProductSection
    index.tsx
    /nested
      FeatureItem.tsx
/pages
  Home.tsx
/assets
  /images
  /icons
```

## File Conventions

### Component Files (`.tsx`)

- **Named exports** for better tree-shaking
- **Props interfaces** defined at the top
- **Tailwind classes** for styling
- **Data attributes** for testing (`data-testid`)

Example output:

```tsx
import React from 'react';

interface ButtonProps {
  label: string;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
  onClick?: () => void;
}

export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({
  label,
  variant = 'primary',
  onClick
}) => {
  return (
    <button
      data-testid="button-component"
      className={`px-4 py-2 rounded-lg font-medium ${
        variant === 'primary'
          ? 'bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-700'
          : 'bg-gray-200 text-gray-800 hover:bg-gray-300'
      }`}
      onClick={onClick}
    >
      {label}
    </button>
  );
};
```

### Styling Approach

Bitloops uses **Tailwind CSS** for all styling because:

- Perfect mapping from design tokens to code
- No separate CSS files to manage
- Consistent, predictable output
- Easy to modify and extend
- Industry-standard adoption

See [Core Concepts: Tailwind CSS](../core-concepts/tailwind-css.md) for more details on why we chose Tailwind.

### Data Attributes

Every element generated by Bitloops includes stable data attributes (data IDs). These serve multiple purposes:

- **Testing** — Reliable selectors for Cypress, Playwright, or other testing tools
- **Tracking** — Internal mapping between design and code
- **Reconciliation** — Helps Bitloops understand your component when regenerating

:::warning Important
Do not modify or remove data IDs. They are essential for Bitloops' internal logic and testing infrastructure.

## Customization Options

Once code is generated, you have full control:

### What You Can Modify

- Rename components, props, and files
- Restructure the folder organization
- Add custom logic and state management
- Integrate with your existing codebase
- Add additional styling or override Tailwind classes

### What You Should Preserve

- **Data attributes** (`data-testid`, etc.) — Required for testing and Bitloops tracking
- **Import structure** — If using nested components, maintain the import paths

### Re-generation

Bitloops won't overwrite your manual changes unless you explicitly choose to regenerate a component. This means:

- Your edits are safe
- You can continue attaching snapshots after editing
- You can selectively regenerate specific components while keeping others

## Integration with Your Stack

The generated code is designed to work seamlessly with:

- **Next.js** — The primary target framework
- **React** — Standard JSX patterns
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first styling
- **Storybook** — Optional story generation
- **Cypress/Playwright** — Test-ready with data attributes
- **TypeScript** — Full type safety
