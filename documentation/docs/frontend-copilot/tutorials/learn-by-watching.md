## Tutorial: Create your first component (end-to-end)

This is the fastest way to understand the Bitloops workflow in one sitting: **Import design → Add Designs to Project → Select ELements in Design View → Create Component → Attach Snapshots → Iterate → Build Parent Components**.

### **What you’ll learn**

- How to import figma pages and add designs to projects
- How to selection elements in **Design View**
- How to create a component and where it shows up in the **Components** tab
- How snapshots represent both **instances** (same component, different data) and **variants** (state differences)
- How to iterate using **Snapshot View ↔ Component View ↔ Code File**
- When to add **Layout Containers** to make layout intent explicit

### **Quick outline**
1. Open a project (demo design)
2. Select a frame or element group
3. **Create Component**
4. Attach snapshots
5. Edit the `.tsx` file and validate in Component View
6. Optional: add a Layout Container to fix grouping/layout
