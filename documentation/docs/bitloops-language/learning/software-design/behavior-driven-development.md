# Behavior Driven Development

Behavior-driven development (BDD) serves as a framework that connects the technical team with the business owners and stakeholders. It is an agile software development procedure that creates better collaboration between developers, product owners & managers, customer representatives, analysts and any other stakeholdersduring the software development process. This technique follows up on the ideas of TDD, domain-driven design, and object-oriented analysis and design.

BDD provides a common space for optimal understanding of the project and aids in sharing between software developers and the business management team. It helps the non-technical team to get a clear picture of the software development process and describes in-depth the expected outcomes. This, in turn, enlightens the developers to work for what is required and assists in optimal productivity during the software development process. BDD displays a new look at the project by considering both business interests and technical perspectives.

The primary goal of BDD is to ensure that software development is focused on delivering value to the business by enabling teams to identify and address issues early in the development process. BDD emphasizes collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders, which helps to reduce the risk of errors and issues in production. Additionally, BDD helps to ensure that the software meets the needs of the business by focusing on business requirements and user needs.


## Key Concepts and Terminology

Behavior-driven development (BDD) is built on a set of key concepts and terminology that help teams to communicate and collaborate effectively during the software development process. Here are some of the most important concepts and terms:

- **Feature:** A feature is a piece of functionality that provides business value. A feature is typically described in a user story or scenario.

- **User story:** A user story is a short, simple description of a feature or functionality from the perspective of the user or customer.

- **Scenario:** A scenario is a specific example of how a user might interact with the software to achieve a specific outcome. Scenarios are typically written in a specific format using Given-When-Then clauses.

- **Acceptance criteria:** Acceptance criteria are the conditions that must be met for a user story or scenario to be considered complete. Acceptance criteria are used to define the scope of a feature and to help ensure that the feature meets the needs of the business.

- **Given-When-Then:** Given-When-Then is a format for writing BDD scenarios that consists of three parts. The Given clause sets up the initial context for the scenario, the When clause describes the action or event that triggers the scenario, and the Then clause describes the expected outcome or result of the scenario.

- **Step definitions:** Step definitions are the code implementation of the Given-When-Then clauses. They describe the actions that the software should take in response to the scenario.

By using these concepts and terms consistently, BDD provides a common language for all stakeholders involved in the software development process. 

This language helps to ensure that everyone has a clear understanding of the features being developed, the scenarios being tested, and the acceptance criteria that must be met for a feature to be considered complete. 

It also helps to reduce the risk of misunderstandings and miscommunications between developers, testers, and business stakeholders, which can ultimately result in a better quality product.

BDD follows the concepts of domain-driven design to illustrate the user story in ubiquitous language. This language is comfortable for both technical and non-technical people involved in the software development process, smoothing the communication channel across different levels of people from expert developers to managers from different working streams who lack technical knowledge.

BDD uses semi-formal language to meet the expectations of both developers and non-technical business owners. It is in human-readable format, making it effortless for developers, stakeholders, and customer representatives to handle them without any prior training.


## Benefits of BDD

Behavior-driven development (BDD) offers several advantages for software development teams. Here are some of the key benefits:

A. Improved collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders: BDD promotes better communication and collaboration between all stakeholders involved in the software development process. By using a common language and set of concepts, BDD helps to ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goals.

B. Reduced risk of errors and issues in production: By focusing on behavior and outcomes, BDD helps to identify potential issues and errors early in the development process. This allows teams to address them before they become larger problems and result in costly production issues.

C. Narrow down the focus: BDD helps developers to narrow down their focus on the essential features of the project, thereby saving time and resources. By ensuring that the software development process meets the business goals without any controversy, BDD helps developers to know exactly what to build to successfully reach the expected destination.

D. Natural Language: BDD uses Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to describe the behavior of the software solution, allowing for simple English sentences to convey the functionalities of the product. This makes it easier for non-technical team members to understand the working features of the project.

E. Boost productivity: BDD enhances productivity in the code development process by removing unwanted codes and increasing efficiency in reaching the correct solution quickly. By identifying and discarding irrelevant functionalities, BDD helps developers to connect with the essential features to work hassle-free. This technique helps prioritize necessary features in the solution, refining the overall development process.

By incorporating BDD into the software development process, teams can benefit from improved collaboration, reduced risks, streamlined focus, better communication, and boosted productivity. These benefits ultimately lead to a higher quality product that meets the needs of both the business and the end-users.


## Traditional software development vs  BDD

In traditional development process, the business owner conveys the software requirements to the product developer, who drafts a requirement document that is then shared with the developer and tester. The focus is on writing codes and test cases, and after executing the tests, changes are made and retesting is performed until the final product is delivered. However, in this process, the developers and testers are not involved in understanding the system's behavior, leading to potential miscommunication and errors in the final product.

On the other hand, BDD involves a collaborative approach, including the product owners, developers, and testers in the system behavior discussion. They create a user story and document it with examples using a specific language like Gherkin. This document is then shared with the entire team, from business owners to testers, serving as a key element of the software product. The focus is on understanding the system's behavior and developing the necessary code to meet the business goals, reducing the risk of errors and issues in production.

Another key difference is that the traditional process can lead to a lack of clarity and focus, with developers spending time on unnecessary research work. In contrast, BDD narrows down the focus, saving developers time and enabling them to focus on the essential codes. 

The efficient usage of resources also helps fasten the development process, leading to timely delivery of solutions. Additionally, BDD adopts natural language, making it easier for non-technical team members to understand the system's functionalities. 

This enhances collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders, leading to improved productivity and a higher quality end product.


## Implementing BDD

When implementing BDD in software development, it is crucial to define user stories and acceptance criteria. User stories are brief descriptions of a feature's functionality, whereas acceptance criteria define the expected behavior of the system to ensure it meets the user's needs. 

User stories and acceptance criteria enable developers to understand the end-user requirements and ensure that they deliver a product that satisfies those requirements. This information forms the foundation of BDD scenarios, which describe the interaction between the user and the software to achieve a particular outcome.

After creating user stories and acceptance criteria, the development team can create BDD scenarios that demonstrate how the system should behave when fulfilling user requirements. BDD scenarios are written in a plain English language that is easy for all stakeholders to understand, including developers, testers, and business analysts. Each BDD scenario must have a specific outcome that verifies the system's behavior, and it must be written in a way that describes the action and the expected result.

Identifying and using appropriate testing tools and frameworks is another critical step in implementing BDD in software development. Tools and frameworks help automate the testing process, allowing developers to focus on writing code instead of manually testing it. 

Various BDD frameworks, such as Cucumber, SpecFlow, and Behave, enable developers to create and execute BDD scenarios in different programming languages such as Java, Python, and Ruby. Additionally, integrating BDD frameworks with continuous integration and delivery tools, such as Jenkins and CircleCI, ensures that the software is continuously tested, deployed, and delivered to end-users.

## BDD Framework Example

The main idea behind BDD is to break down bigger problems into smaller units and analyze them to determine essential features. This process is similar to unit testing, but instead of testing code functionality, it analyzes the behavior of the program.

During the analysis phase, unwanted functionalities should be removed, leaving a clear picture of what is required. Essentially, once the solution development procedure begins, the behavior tests should pass effortlessly, with the coder focusing on the relevant code performing similar actions. 

Built-in keywords like "When," "Given," and "Then" are used to display the process involved in executing the feature. BDD defines the starting point of the software development process, conveys the testing factors, forecasts the test quantities, and analyzes the test failures to figure out the causes of unfavorable outcomes.

BDD describes behavior as user stories, with unit tests using simple English commands and acceptance tests including a user story with a standard Agile framework. The user story template includes keywords like:
- Title: write a short introduction on the product behavior
- As a: end user details
- I want: expected behavior
- So that: conveys the application of that specific behavior or scenario
- Given: initial data while starting the scenario
- And: additional data while starting the scenario
- When: the specific event that triggers the scenario
- Then:expected outcomes

The use of simple words in BDD statements gives developers a clear picture of expected features and helps them write code only for specific features without confusion. BDD can be used at any point in the development cycle to obtain a better understanding, reducing time and increasing productivity during the development procedure.

## BDD Best Practices 

BDD is an effective approach to software development that promotes collaboration, communication, and a shared understanding of the software's behavior. However, to optimize BDD for software development, there are some best practices that developers should follow.

1. **Keep scenarios simple and focused:** BDD scenarios should be written in a way that is easy for all stakeholders to understand, including developers, testers, and business analysts. Scenarios should focus on one specific behavior and describe it in simple terms. Complex scenarios can lead to confusion, misunderstandings, and misinterpretations, which can result in errors and delays in the software development process.

2. **Use a common language for all stakeholders:** BDD scenarios are written in plain English or a domain-specific language that everyone in the team can understand. Using a common language promotes collaboration, communication, and a shared understanding of the software's behavior. It also reduces the risk of misunderstandings, misinterpretations, and errors.

3. **Regularly review and update:** Scenarios should be reviewed regularly to ensure that they are still relevant and accurate. As the software evolves, scenarios may need to be updated to reflect changes in user requirements, new features, or bug fixes. Regularly reviewing and updating scenarios helps ensure that the software meets the user's needs and that the development team is delivering a quality product.

4. **Involve all stakeholders in the BDD process:** BDD requires collaboration and communication between developers, testers, business analysts, and end-users. All stakeholders should be involved in creating, reviewing, and updating scenarios to ensure that the software meets the user's needs and that it is delivered on time and within budget.

In summary, keep scenarios simple and focused, use a common language for all stakeholders, regularly review and update scenarios, and involve all stakeholders in the BDD process.

## Challenges of BDD

The biggest challenge to implementing BDD in an organization is the resistance to change. BDD requires a shift in mindset and approach, and not all stakeholders may be willing to adopt this new methodology. Some may be hesitant to change their traditional ways of working or may not understand the benefits of BDD. It is crucial to communicate the advantages of BDD and address any concerns or reservations that stakeholders may have. Providing training and support to the team can also help overcome resistance to change.

There are naturally some initial obstacles or "setup costs" when implementing BDD as everyone gets comfortable with the approach and terminology, however, once its understand and adopted, the benefits greatly outweigh the initial costs. In addition, BDD requires collaboration and communication between developers, testers, business analysts, and end-users, so a continuous committment to the process is required.

Choosing the right tool and framework to support BDD is also not trivial as it can dictate the success of BDD implementaiton in an organization. Its important to check for  compatibility, supporting programming language and report generation features to bring out the expected outcomes. The proper selection of the tools and framework reduces the complexities in building the software product for your needs.


## BDD in Agile Development

BDD fits perfectly into the Agile development process, as it emphasizes collaboration and communication among stakeholders. BDD scenarios are written in a language that everyone can understand, including developers, testers, business analysts, and end-users. It helps in creating a shared understanding of the software's behavior, and it encourages collaboration between the team members. The Agile methodology promotes delivering software in small increments, and BDD helps in achieving this by breaking down the requirements into small scenarios that can be developed, tested, and deployed in each sprint.

BDD can also be used for backlog refinement and sprint planning in Agile development. The scenarios can be used to prioritize the backlog items based on their importance and to identify the dependencies between them. The scenarios can also be used to estimate the effort required to complete each item, making sprint planning more accurate and predictable. The team can use BDD scenarios to discuss the requirements and agree on the expected behavior before they start coding, which can help in avoiding misunderstandings and delays during the development process.

BDD can also be integrated into the continuous integration and delivery process in Agile development. BDD scenarios can be automated using tools and frameworks, making it possible to run them as part of the continuous integration pipeline. This can help in detecting issues early in the development process and ensure that the software is always in a working state. BDD scenarios can also be used to verify that the software meets the acceptance criteria before it is released to production, ensuring that the software meets the customer's needs and expectations.

In conclusion, BDD is a perfect fit for Agile development, as it encourages collaboration, communication, and delivering software in small increments. BDD can be used for backlog refinement and sprint planning, and it can be integrated into the continuous integration and delivery process, making it an essential part of the Agile development process. By using BDD in Agile development, teams can ensure that they deliver high-quality software that meets the customer's needs and expectations.


## Conclusion

In conclusion, BDD has proven to be an essential aspect of software development, providing numerous benefits and best practices for implementation. BDD helps to improve overall productivity and ease the software development process by ensuring all stakeholders are involved and committed, keeping scenarios simple and focused, using a common language for all stakeholders, regularly reviewing and updating scenarios, and choosing appropriate tools and frameworks. BDD also fits well into the Agile development process, helping to refine backlogs and sprint planning while also serving as part of continuous integration and delivery.

Despite the benefits of BDD, there are potential challenges that may arise, such as overcoming resistance to change, ensuring all stakeholders are involved and committed, and choosing the appropriate tools and frameworks. However, with the right mindset and approach, these challenges can be overcome, and the benefits of BDD can be realized.
