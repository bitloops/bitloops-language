Bitloops simplifies frontend development by **automating the design-to-code process**, generating professional-grade frontend code, and handling design assets with minimal manual input. Here's a step-by-step overview of how it works:  

### **1. Import Your Figma File**  

Start by **importing your Figma file** into Bitloops. This file serves as the source of truth for your design system, containing all frames, components, and assets.  

#### **What Bitloops Imports:**  
- **Frames and Design Elements:** UI components, screens, and pages.  
- **Visual Assets:** Icons, logos, and images.  
- **Fonts and Colors:** Ensuring consistent design fidelity.  

### **2. Add a Design Frame to Your Project**  

Once your Figma file is imported, **add individual design frames** to your Bitloops project. A design frame can be anything from a simple button to an entire webpage layout.  

#### **Why This Step Matters:**  
- **Selective Import:** Focus only on relevant parts of your design.  
- **Organized Workflow:** Add and manage frames one at a time for easier component generation.  

### **3. Convert Design Frames into Components**  

After adding a design frame, **select a specific frame** and let Bitloops work its magic. Bitloops **analyzes the frame**, generates code, and extracts assetsâ€”all while ensuring **design fidelity** and **responsive behavior**.

#### **What Bitloops Generates:**  
- **Production-Ready Code:** React or Next.js components following industry best practices.  
- **Storybook Story:** An interactive preview of your component.  
- **Property Tests:** Tests for font sizes, colors, dimensions, and layout accuracy.  
- **Responsiveness Tests:** Validations ensuring the component works on all devices.  
- **Assets Export:** Automatic export of icons, images, and fonts into the appropriate folders.  
- **Prop Definitions:** Automatically generated prop names and default values based on design context.  
- **Component Naming:** Meaningful component names reflecting their purpose in the project.

### **4. Customize and Export the Code**  

Once code generation is complete, you can **review, refine, and export** the generated code directly into your project.  

#### **Customization Options:**  
- **Code Editing:** Adjust components, props, and styles as needed.  
- **Project Integration:** Export components into your codebase for immediate use.  
- **Team Collaboration:** Maintain consistent code standards for your entire team.

## **Upcoming Features (Coming Soon ðŸš€)**  

Bitloops is constantly evolving. Hereâ€™s a sneak peek at some upcoming features designed to take your design-to-code experience even further:  

#### **1. Automatic Nested Component Generation**  
- Detect nested components within a frame.  
- Automatically create child components, define props, and link instances.  

#### **2. Defining Instances of Existing Components**  
- Select parts of a frame that reference already-defined components.  
- **Reuse instead of re-creating**â€”reducing duplicated work and improving project scalability.  

#### **3. Import Existing Code Components**  
- Import pre-existing components into Bitloops and **integrate them seamlessly** into your projects.  

#### **4. Full Page Conversion & Automatic Component Breakdown**  
- Select an **entire page frame** in Figma and let Bitloops identify and break it into components.  
- **Component Identification:** Automatically detect buttons, forms, cards, and more.  
- **Bottom-Up Approach:** Build components from the smallest elements up to entire pages.  
- **User Confirmation Workflow:** Review and approve detected components before generation.
