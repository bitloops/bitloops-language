The Bitloops team wants to help as much as possible, so we also provide you with the ability to book a [One-to-One Discussion](https://calendly.com/bitloops/30min?month=2022-11) with someone from the Bitloops team who will be able to provide you with a live and informal 30-minute video session.

We know there should be more documentation, but bear with us, the team is still small. We would love any feedback or help on this.
