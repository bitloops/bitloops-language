### **What to Expect**  

While Bitloops handles most design-to-code scenarios effortlessly, certain limitations can occur due to:  

- **Unsupported Elements:** Some complex Figma elements may not yet be fully supported.  
- **Fallback Issues:** Bitloops uses several proprietary algorithms and custom AI models, however, we haven't been able to test all scnearios. Our fallback logic kicks in when somehthing unexpected is detected, but it might not always produce the expected results.

### **Troubleshooting Guide**  

#### **1. Component not generated**  
**Cause:**  
- Fall back option did not work 
- An unsupported Figma feature was used (e.g., overly complex SVGs).  

**Solution:**  
- Delete the component and try again
- Try building a smaller component first

#### **2. Unresponsive Tests or Errors in Storybook**  
**Cause:**  
- Code-generation process interrupted.  
- CSS / Responsiveness decisions where not the best for the circumastance 

**Solution:**  
- Try deleting and re-creating the component again
- Manually edit the code to your preference and email us your needs
