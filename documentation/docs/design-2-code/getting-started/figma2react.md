### Introduction to Figma to React/Next.js Conversion
Welcome to the comprehensive guide on converting your Figma designs into dynamic React or Next.js applications using Bitloops. 

In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, the ability to seamlessly translate visual designs into functional, responsive web applications can save a developers hours, days or even weeks of work. 

Bitloops is building an AI-powered solution that automates the design-to-code process, ensuring efficiency, accuracy, and a significant reduction in development time. This guide is tailored to help both designers and developers navigate how best to leverage Bitloops to build a more collaborative and productive workflow.

### Getting Started with Figma and Bitloops
The journey begins with setting up your creative and development environments. 

Ensure your Figma account is active and your designs are ready for conversion. Bitloops seamlessly integrates with Figma through Artie, our AI-agent. Simply invite Artie (ai@bitloops.com) to your Figma project, and you can start asking questions and asking for conversions! Artie will ask you to login if you haven't done so already. 

Now, you should also install Bitloops' [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Bitloops.bitloops) as its this tool that will conduct the actual conversion into code for you. 

### Preparing Your Figma Design for Conversion
Well actually, you don't need to do anything here. 

Bitloops has been designed to make some decisions, like an engineer or frontend developer would. 

However, if you prefer, you can organize your Figma file by using descriptive names for layers and ensuring components are logically grouped. Any specific changes will be respected.  

You can also create responsive designs (mobile, tablet), but thats again where Bitloops adds so much value. It will generate a mobile & tablet view for you, ensuring your application's adaptability across devices. 

### Using Bitloops to Convert Figma Designs to React/Next.js
Ok, now it's time to bring your design to life. 

Simply tag Artie on your design and ask him to convert the design. Here's a comment you can copy: "@Artie convert this design into code please." 

Artie will now reply and say its ready to be converted. Go to VS Code, install the Bitloops extension and select the design for conversion. So that's what you do.

In VS Code, you simply log into Bitloops' extension, see all the designs you've requested to be converted, select the one you want converted and then clarify if you want React, Next.js, Astro, and what's your preferred CSS

This process will take a few minutes.... 

### Working with the Generated Code
Once complete, you'll receive React or Next.js code that's ready to be integrated into your project. The code is structured and organized, adhering to the best coding practices. In essence, Bitloops does the following:
- Extracts the assets (images, logo, etc.) into an Asset folder, which can be further segmented into the specific "Sections"
- Identifies the Sections of a website, generating tailored and appropriate names (if not provided) for each section
- Uses these sections across the code, asset and text generation
- Extracts the text and places them in specific files in a Data folder (again brokendown by section) so its very easy to edit text or even use it for translations, etc. 
- Identify components of the design and generate specific code for each component, leveraging props so they can be reused as needed
- Create variants of the components when appropriate instead of new components
- Generate all the code that would bring the elements, components and sections together to form your website page
- Build all the appropriate CSS and responsiveness to ensure the design works across devices, and is adaptive at precisely the right moments 

Its super easy to familiarize yourself with the file organization and component structure, and then you can customize as necessary to align the code with your specific project, but its minor touches.

### Advanced Features & best practices (comming soon)
We have many ideas on how to make this tool even better and more useful to developers, but would love your input. 

Some ideas we're working on are:
- Synchronization: essentially, allow Bitloops to read and analyze your code base to identify components that you've already built to use in one of the designs you're currently converting
- Two way sync with Figma: how cool would it be if Bitloops was able to generate the mobile & tablet version of the design it created back on Figma?
- Ability to import specific CSS settings, or selecting from specific libraries
- Offering alternative IDEs to VS Code
- Support other design platforms
- Offer deployment and hosting services
- Manage all SEO requirements when building each page 

### Troubleshooting Common Issues
There may be some issues as we're still fine-tuning the model and the process. If you already have access, feel free to reach out to us via Discord or directly via email (hello@bitloops.com). 

### Conclusion and Next Steps
As you can see, converting a Figma design into a React/Next.js application is going to be super easy and fast. Whilst it won't be perfect to begin with, it will save you time and you'll be able to deploy new features and products faster.
