Whether you’re new to Bitloops or looking to maximize its potential, this FAQ section has you covered. We’ve compiled answers to the most common questions developers ask, from understanding core concepts like components and property tests to exploring advanced features like responsiveness and team collaboration. Dive in to learn how Bitloops simplifies frontend development, saves you time, and empowers you to deliver high-quality code with confidence.

### **1. What is a component in Bitloops?**  
A **Component** in Bitloops is a coded UI element generated from a Figma design frame. Components can be as simple as buttons, icons, or text fields, or as complex as entire webpage sections or reusable design patterns.  

Each component is:  
- **Reusable:** Easily used across multiple parts of your project.  
- **Testable:** Comes with built-in property and responsiveness tests.  
- **Customizable:** Modify or extend components to suit your project’s needs.  

By turning your Figma designs into reusable and high-quality code components, Bitloops streamlines your development process and ensures scalability.

---

### **2. What are property tests, and why are they important?**  
**Property Tests** are automated checks that validate the core design properties of a component. They ensure the code matches your Figma design exactly, reducing the need for manual QA.  

These tests verify properties such as:  
- **Font Details:** Size, type, weight, and color.  
- **Element Dimensions:** Width, height, margins, and padding.  
- **Positioning:** Alignment, layout constraints, and spacing rules.  

**Why are they important?**  
- They prevent inconsistencies between your designs and the final code.  
- They save time on manual validation, letting you focus on higher-value tasks.

### **3. What happens if my component fails a test?**  
When a component fails a test, Bitloops provides detailed feedback highlighting the issue. Here’s how it helps:  

1. **Test Results:** You’ll see specific test results that pinpoint mismatched properties, such as incorrect dimensions, colors, or fonts.  
2. **Actionable Feedback:** The feedback provided allows users to adjust the generated code.  
3. **Iterative Testing:** Once adjustments are made, simply save the file and the tests are rerun to confirm all issues have been resolved.  

This ensures that every component meets your project’s quality standards before deployment.

### **4. Do I have to define buttons and other elements manually?**  
Currently, specific UI elements such as **Text Fields**, and **Images** are automatically identified whilst **Buttons** require manual definition in Bitloops. This ensures accuracy in assigning properties like functionality and dynamic content.  

**Exciting Update:** Automatic detection of common UI elements like buttons is a **feature coming soon!** This will further streamline your workflow and reduce setup time.

### **5. How does Bitloops handle responsiveness?**  
Responsiveness is critical to delivering a seamless user experience across devices. Bitloops has built a process using its own algorithms and AI to analyze and build a codebase that supports responsiveness for each specific component. Moreover, it automatically runs **Responsiveness Tests** to ensure components adapt to various screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.  

These tests validate:  
- **Element Resizing:** Components and containers resize appropriately without losing design fidelity.  
- **Alignment and Spacing:** Adjustments are made to maintain proper positioning and spacing across breakpoints.  
- **Breakpoints Compatibility:** Designs are checked against standard screen resolutions for common devices.  

**How it works:**  
- Bitloops analyzes your design’s constraints and layout rules.  
- It identifies areas requiring adjustments for smaller or larger screens.  
- Feedback is provided to help you fine-tune your design or code.  

By automating responsiveness, Bitloops ensures a consistent and high-quality experience for end-users on any device.

### **6. Can I use Bitloops with non-Figma designs?**  
Currently, Bitloops is optimized for Figma designs. However, support for additional design tools like Adobe XD or Sketch is part of our **future roadmap**. Stay tuned for updates as we expand compatibility!

---

### **7. What programming languages and frameworks does Bitloops support?**  
Bitloops generates **React** code and specifically for **Nextjs**. Support for additional frameworks and programming languages like Vue, Angular, Svelte, or plain HTML/CSS is being planned as part of our future expansion.  

---

### **8. How do I customize the generated code?**  
Bitloops allows you to export fully customizable code. Once generated, you can:  
- Edit the code in your preferred IDE (e.g., **VS Code**).  
- Modify styles, props, and logic to meet project-specific requirements.  
- Integrate it with backend services or extend functionality as needed.  

---

### **9. Can I use Bitloops for dynamic components or interactive elements?**  
Yes, Bitloops can generate dynamic components, but you’ll need to define interactions and dynamic behaviors (like onClick events or API calls) manually in the code. Advanced support for common interactions is on the roadmap.

---

### **10. How does Bitloops help with collaboration?**  
Bitloops bridges the gap between designers and developers by:  
- Ensuring that design-to-code mappings are consistent and transparent.  
- Providing detailed test results for resolving discrepancies quickly.  
- Allowing seamless sharing and updates between team members.  

---

### **11. What happens to my existing codebase?**  
Currently, Bitloops operates in parallel to your existing codebase. In the near future we will allow users to integrate existing codebases into Bitloops including: 
- Importing existing components into your Bitloops project structure.  
- Using those components in the creation of new Components, Sections or Pages

---

### **12. Is Bitloops suitable for enterprise projects?**  
Absolutely! Bitloops is designed to handle projects of all sizes, including enterprise-level applications. Its ability to generate clean, scalable, and maintainable code ensures a consistent and professional-grade output for large teams and complex systems.

---

### **13. What security measures does Bitloops use to protect my designs?**  
Your design files are securely handled using industry-standard encryption protocols. Bitloops ensures:  
- Data is stored and processed securely.  
- Files are accessible only by authorized users.  
- Compliance with GDPR and other relevant data protection regulations.

---

### **14. Does Bitloops offer team collaboration features?**  
Not yet, but its coming! Bitloops will support team accounts where multiple users can:  
- Work on shared projects.  
- Review test results and make adjustments collaboratively.  
- Manage permissions and access levels for better team coordination.
