## Introduction to Bitloops

Bitloops is an innovative AI-powered development tool designed to streamline the front-end development process. 

Our mission is to empower software engineers to do more of what they like doing, which is to solve problems through code. And we can do that by reducing the manual effort traditionally involved in converting designs to code. 

The average frontend engineer will spend 1-4 days converting a single website page design into code, depending on the design complexity, the output language chosen and the developer's experience. And most of this time is spent ensuring commas are in the right place, CSS variables are being used correctly and the responsiveness is correct across device sizes and browsers. 

Many of these tasks are fairly repetitive, of low added value and simply require someone to do the hard work of going through them and getting it right. Well, this is where Bitloops comes in and does +90% of this work for you. 

Bitloops is designed supports a range of design formats and outputs code that is responsive, adaptive, and maintains the fidelity of the original design, catering to the needs of startups, SMEs, and large enterprises alike. Moreover, our backgrounds as developers in enterprise settings means our number one focus is high quality code that can be easily understood and maintained.
