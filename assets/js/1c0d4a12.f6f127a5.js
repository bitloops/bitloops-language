"),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"For example, both Onion Architecture and Hexagonal Architecture rely on inversion of control and dependency injection to manage dependencies between layers. However, they differ in how they implement this. In Hexagonal Architecture, the core application logic is decoupled from external dependencies using ports, which are then implemented by adapters that handle communication with external systems or services. However, to correctly setup a Hexagonal Architecture, each adaptor should be  placed in an independent artifact and not into a single artifact for all ports, whereas the Onion Architecture promotes a layer that governs all of the relationships with the application."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Therefore, it could be said that Hexagonal Architecture is a step further in terms of modularity of components, however, both of them really promote separation of concern, modularity and high-quality software.
