## üöÄ Build great modular monoliths or microservices faster, much faster

Bitloops Language (BL) is a high-productivity, domain specific language (DSL) that helps you focus on the business logic of your application which is what really matters.

It incorporates software development best practices and design methodologies such as [DDD](https://bitloops.com/docs/bitloops-language/learning/domain-driven-design), [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) and [Layered/Hexagonal Architecture](https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture/). 

The Bitloops Language guides and empowers any software developer to write clean code and build high-quality & well designed software. This is particularly relevant for server application software that has complex, and frequently changing business requirements. With BL, developers can build software using principles such as separation of concerns, loose coupling, high cohesion and command query responsibility segregation (CQRS), which ensure systems are easier to understand, maintain and change. 

With Bitloops Language, developers are able to:
1. **Write clean code** in an intuitive and structured approach
2. Follow **best practices** to ensure the code and software can be easily understood by other developers
3. Create objects with **high cohesion and loose coupling** between each other
4. **Separate the busienss logic** from the **technical aspects** which leads to more **robust and flexible systems**
5. **Focus on the core domain** or problem, and not worry about boilerplate code and implementation details

In essence, software developers can focus on what they do best: **solving problems!** With the Bitloops Language developers write code that will allow other developers (and even themselves after 6 months) to easily understand and build on top of that code.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Quick Start

The best and fastest way to understand how the Bitloops Language helps you write clean code and great software is to follow the instructions below. With this tutorial, you will run and execute a Bitloops ToDo App, learn how Bitloops works, and see the output files in TypeScript and appreciate how the Bitloops Language works. 

If you face any issues (especially with Windows) check the [Common Issues](#common-issues) Section below.

### 1 - Install the Transpiler
Bitloops still hasn't created binaries, so the best way to install and run the transpiler is to install the Bitloops Language CLI as a global npm package. Copy the following and run it in your IDE:

```console
npm install -g @bitloops/bitloops-language-cli
```

Alternatively, you can use yarn: 

```console
yarn global add @bitloops/bitloops-language-cli
```

### 2 - Clone the ToDo App example repo
The Bitloops [ToDo App](https://github.com/bitloops/bitloops-language/tree/main/examples/todo/bl-source) is readily available for cloning. You can extract the files following the link or clone it using the command below:

  ```console
  git clone https://github.com/bitloops/bitloops-language.git
  ```

### 3 - Run the Bitloops Transpiler
The next step is to transpile the ToDo App code from Bitloops Language Code into TypeScript code. Transpile comes from the word Transcompile, and means the translation of code from one programming language to another. 

macOS / Linux
  ```console
  bl transpile -s bitloops-language/examples/todo/bl-source/ -t output
  ```
Windows
  ```console
  bl transpile -s bitloops-language\examples\todo\bl-source\ -t output
  ```
or
  ```console
  bitloops-language transpile
  ```

That's it! You can now run the following to see how many lines of code you saved yourself (spoiler alert: 77% or 2141 LoC!)
  ```console
  bl analyze-lines -bl bitloops-language\examples\todo\bl-source -ts ./output
  ```

Ok now you have all your business logic beautifully transpiled into well structured TypeScript code üéâüéâüéâ! 

## BUT wait! What about the server and all the infrastructure code? How am I supposed to run this? 

The scope of the Bitloops Language ends here but using Bitloops you can automatically generate everything else using Bitloops magic and AI! Bitloops will generate for you a Nest.js project and all the required infrastructure (gRPC or REST controllers, repository adapters for PostgreSQL or Mongo etc.) as well as docker or K8s files to deploy your system. To learn more about the automatic Bitloops process [click here].

Alternatively, you are free to use any framework you like or just an Express server or Fastify server etc.

## Common Issues

- In Windows, if you are (still) using PowerShell, you will probably come across the error "running scripts is disabled on this system". To fix this, you can do the following:
1. Open PowerShell with Run as Administrator (right click on the icon and select the option from the menu).
2. Run the following command in PowerShell
```console
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```
3. Type Y and press Enter.

## üëè What are the benefits of using Bitloops Language?

* Software you'll be proud of! Well designed and written, easy to understand and follow!
* High productivity by focusing on the core domain/problem, having less boilerplate code to build, manage and debug and more quickly being able to develop new features 
* Easy to learn and intuitive syntax 
* Learn about key software development best practices, patterns and methodologies such as [Domain-Driven Design (DDD)](https://bitloops.com/docs/bitloops-language/learning/domain-driven-design), [Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development), [Test-Driven Development (TDD)](http://agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html) and [Layered / Hexagonal Architecture](https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture/).
* Testing is treated as a 1st class citizen in the software development process
* Switch between Modular Monolith or Microservices architecture within minutes as all messages are moved through either in-memory or distributed message buses depending on your deployment choice
* Significantly reduce the amount of boilerplate code you need to write, maintain and debug
* Improved alignment between business and engineering with a natural ubiquitous language
* Ability to transpiles to widely used programming languages for maximum compatibility with existing code (currently [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) support, Kotlin, C#, Go, Java, C++ or maybe even Rust or [Carbon](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang) to follow in the future)

## ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Why build the Bitloops Language?

There are numerous great programming languages out there with massive and growing
codebases and investments. However, the most common problem faced by organizations
that build and maintain systems, with teams of developers working on them, is
good architecture and design of an interconnected system of services; 

Designing a complex system so that it can last through time and will allow developers (existing and new joiners) to work on its codebase with steady (or hopefully) increasing productivity is very difficult. 

Good testing is an additional major requirement of long lasting products which is also made possible by good architecture and design. Unfortunately, there aren't enough knowledgeable and experienced senior
engineers around the world to build and maintain great systems for all who need them.
Even when a company is lucky enough to have some, it is unable to hire more junior engineers than the senior ones can review their work and guide in order to make sure the system does not degrade over time due to bad design decisions.

The Bitloops Language is the first programming language that aims to address these issues
by making it much easier to adopt important software engineering principles and patterns
such as [Domain-Driven Design](https://bitloops.com/docs/bitloops-language/learning/domain-driven-design) and Behavior-Driven Development, without requiring many years
of experience to do so successfully. As a result, the work of senior engineers can be further
leveraged and the contributions of junior engineers significantly boosted.


## ü•Ö Language Goals

Every software engineer has a common goal: we want to write better code and build better software, and we want to do this faster! 

However, this can only be achieved with significant and continuous dedication, learning and experience, which takes a lot of time. Bitloops wants to significantly reduce the time it takes a developer to start building high-quality software, and we have built the Bitloops Language that already incorporates many of the software development best practices and design methodologies. 

Ultimately, BL's goals are to:

* Put the focus on the domain and you business logic and automate everything else as much as possible
* Delay infrastructure work and decisions as much as possible as these are implementation details
* Increase developer productivity significantly, not only at the start of a project, but for the entire lifecycle!
* Reduce the time and cost to build new features and products, even on large / complex projects
* Reduce the learning curve (specifically of DDD, BDD and Layered/Hexagonal Architecture) needed to build and maintain great software
* Empower many more software developers to learn & adopt these important principles and best practices
* Reduce the dependency on developer discipline during the code development process, with a structured process
* Make testing a more integral, collaborative, useful, and fun process
* Make domain logic timeless as well as platform & language independent
* Eliminate the need for boilerplate code & enable the reuse of existing packages writen in any language
* Empower software engineers to postpone the need for a microservices architecture until it is strictly needed from a infrastructure perspective to better manage computing and engineering resources (reduce intial costs! üí∞üí∞üí∞) 
* Allow systems to be converted from a modular monolith to a microservices architecture in hours, not months

The Bitloops Language aims to define and retain a simplistic syntax that will be as close to human
language and business logic as possible that will become timeless, helping adopt and use a ubiquitous
language within each module or bounded context. It is then BL's job to transpile into modern and up-to-date syntax of your target language.

Making the Bitloops Language a transpiled language was a core decision to achieve exactly this. By allowing oraganisations to write their business logic in a timeless language that can be transpiled to powerful but also changing target languages without burdening the users of the Bitloops Language with this task. The Bitloops Language will make sure it transpiles to optimized code of relevant, up-to-date, and right-for-the-task languages.

## üìå Project status

The Bitloops Language is currently in early stages. Its transpiler has been created as a proof of concept and is not meant to cover the full range of developer creative code writing at this stage.

We want to better understand whether we can build a language that meets your needs, and whether we can
gather a critical mass of interest within the DDD community and outside of it.

There are many things we want to add in the future including

- [X] CQRS support
- [ ] Event Sourcing support
- [ ] Kotlin target language
- [ ] C# target language
- [ ] Golang target language
- [ ] And many more...

If you're interested in contributing, we would love your help!

## üèó Bitloops -> TypeScript Transpilation

If you are already aware of the DDD concepts (Aggregates, Value Objects, Use Cases, Controller, etc.) and know how to code in any modern programming language, it should be really easy to pick up the Bitloops Language.
It is built out of a consistent set of language constructs that should feel familiar and be easy to read and understand.

While Bitloops is an Object Oriented Language, it doesn't have a generic class. Specific Bitloops classes are build-in as follows: ValueObject, Entity, Root Entity, Command, CommandHandler, Query, QueryHandler, DTO, Props, OK, ApplicationError, DomainError, Error etc.

Bitloops Language code like this (11 lines):

```node
// Bitloops Language:
Rule TitleOutOfBoundsRule(title: string) throws DomainErrors.TitleOutOfBoundsError {
  isBrokenIf(title.length > 150 OR title.length < 4);
}

Props TitleProps {
  string title;
}

ValueObject TitleVO {
  constructor(props: TitleProps): (OK(TitleVO), Errors(DomainErrors.TitleOutOfBoundsError)) {
    applyRules(TitleOutOfBoundsRule(props.title));
  }
}
```

transpiles to this TypeScript code (28 lines):

```node
// TypeScript:
import { Domain, Either, ok, fail } from '@bitloops/bl-boilerplate-core';
import { DomainErrors } from './errors';

export class TitleOutOfBoundsRule implements Domain.IRule {
  constructor(private title: string) {}

  public Error = new DomainErrors.TitleOutOfBounds(this.title);

  public isBrokenIf(): boolean {
    return this.title.length > 150 || this.title.length < 4;
  }
}
                                                            
export namespace Rules {
    export class TitleOutOfBounds extends TitleOutOfBoundsRule {}                                             
}

interface TitleProps {
  title: string;
}

export class TitleVO extends Domain.ValueObject<TitleProps> {
  get title(): string {
    return this.props.title;
  }

  private constructor(props: TitleProps) {
    super(props);
  }

  public static create(props: TitleProps): Either<TitleVO, DomainErrors.TitleOutOfBounds> {
    const res = Domain.applyRules([new Rules.TitleOutOfBounds(props.title)]);
    if (res) return fail(res);
    return ok(new TitleVO(props));
  }
}
```
